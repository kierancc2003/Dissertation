These are example fiels of the data processing taking place for my dissertation project.

Each mass ratio and taper ratio had their own data sets and therefore their own processing scripts, however all are the same apart from the filenames used.

Some scripts have multiple loops performing the same process, but due to the data collected and some specific experiments, these loops were required due to the nature of the flag flapping.

An example raw data set has also been included.
